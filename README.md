# Understanding the Widget Tree
In this chapter, I learned that Widgets are the building blocks of the Flutter user interface, influencing both the appearance and functionality of your app. Flutter assembles its UIs using these widgets, which cannot be altered once created. Each widget defines how a specific part of the UI should appear. I found out that each widget is fixed, outlining the setup for a UI section. The widget tree illustrates the layout of the UI, while the element tree shows the actual widgets displayed on the screen. I discovered that when changes are made to the widget setup, the associated elements are either updated or swapped out. It's better to keep the widget tree straightforward and with fewer layers because this simplifies code management. Flutter allows you to streamline complex widget trees, improving your app's performance and making it easier to troubleshoot problems. Additionally, using constants can help avoid duplication of the same widget arrangements, while methods can assist in organizing the logic. Creating custom widgets enables you to group similar components together.
